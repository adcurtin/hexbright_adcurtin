plan: write everything without sleep modes, do sleep mode testing on other arduino

sleep mode - research sleep modes
	wake up from switch interrupt
	wake up from charge interrupt
	disable ADC during sleep, reenable on wakeup
	if connected to usb / power, don't sleep.
		if charged, keep charge light solid, but at dimmer level

interrupt for switch
	handle state machine and transitions there
		only sleep in off mode. while on, power consumption of micro is negligible
	if only level interrupt and not edge interrupt, debounce interrupt with last_interrupt time
		even for edge interrupt
		will time work across sleep states?
	timeout for transitioning to next mode vs. power off
		1s?

timer interrupt for checking temp?
	only when on

fade indicator for charging

#define for serial comms
	#ifdef / #endif

main loop:
	pretty much do nothing
